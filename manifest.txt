ğŸª·care.

ğŸª·lotus is events, lotus is unusualness, lotus is community, lotus is good vibes, lotus is you - if you want it to be.

ğŸª·resistance towards repetitive overpriced mainstream events. if u want to produce low-effort events, they should be free. 500 czk for entry to a party with mid techno? no, thanks.

ğŸª·we are not bound by hierarchy, because every one of us is a leader. your thoughts, your concepts, your energy - all of it creates lotus. if you have any ideas, share them. nothing is set in stone. this is an open process. 

ğŸª·we believe in gradual bettering. every event should make us and you feel better than the last.

ğŸª·there are no rules, only guidelines. lotus is a continuously evolving entity â€“ not only for the ones organizing but also for the ones attending. no one is above others, everyone is a part of the whole.

ğŸª·always open to meet new friends, new artists, new insights. come hang out, come say hi.

ğŸª·dissolution is not failure. it is liberation from stagnation. lotus will be reborn when people will feel the need to create something real. if lotus ceases to be what it is supposed to be, its journey ends. and that's okay.

ğŸª·when in doubt, bounce on it. when in doubt, unreel your grief to ambient sounds of trees.
